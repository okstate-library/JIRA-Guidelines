## Relevant JIRA terminology
### Sprint
A unit of time which the team agrees on and which remains constant. During a sprint the team implements and delivers a discrete product increment, e.g. a working milestone version.

### Story
A software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language.

### Backlog
A list of the outstanding user stories, bugs and features for a product or sprint.

### Board
The tool that teams use to visualize units of work moving through their specific workflow. It can be adapted for different styles of agile development (e.g. a Scrum board shows work items moving from the product backlog to the sprint backlog whereas a Kanban board typically has a three-step workflow: To Do, In Progress, and Done).

### Daily stand-up
Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync.

### Story Point
A story point is an estimate of the relative complexity of a story. This will help us to decide how much work to accommodate in a sprint

## Best Practices

### Developing software in discrete product increments
Product is built in interative steps vs. incremental. 

### Self organizing teams
Team has the authority to decide what to work on and how to do the work, and how long

### Sprints Planning - Breaking up work
Self Imposed deadlines where the developer can choose how long it takes to work on an issue.
The developers have the opportunity to change course. Opportunity for feedback from stakeholders. 

### Project Planning - Breaking down the project
* Define the goal and the steps needed to reach it
* Prioritize steps
* Define each step in detail
* Identify Dependencies
* Be flexibe. Often we find out we need to do so much more work than we initially anticipate which is fine
* Plan a semester's work at once.(Around 6-7 sprints)
